# About me

I may not know what I don't know but I am curious enough to explore

I like to find simple solutions to complex problems. and I have six cats üêà‚Äç‚¨õ; I wonder if you know how these two things are related üòÖ

### Hi there üëã

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on financial solutions to student loans
- üå± I‚Äôm currently solving [math/algorithm problems](https://github.com/ologbonowiwi/hackerrank-with-go) with [Go](https://go.dev/).
- üì´ How to reach me: [e-mail](mailto:wm4tos.777@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ologbon-owiwi/).

My name is Wesley and I am currently growing on my career and explore new horizons for my life

I'm working with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and web technologies and platforms for the last 4 years üòä

On the beginning of my career, I created PWAs and Cordova apps with Vue.js and [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/). After that, I worked on a big project that has intense flows of data daily-by-daily that was maded with some Facebook fun stuff. The project was created using the following technologies: Node.js, Apollo Server, GraphQL, React.js, Atomic Design and Redux... On that project I learned much about JS, and some interesting stuff about atomic methods and clean code in JavaScript.
After that, I changed my job and started to work as a fullstack developer, with Vue.js again and Node.js in the backend, constructing some _really simple projects_ with React.js and React Native. After that, I changed to the biggest financial company in Brazil ([Cielo](https://www.cielo.com.br/)), to create web applications to improve and promote innovation for the commercial area. The web application was constructed with React.js, AntD and lodash e some good pratices (like immutability, function composition) from functional programming concepts. After that I really discovered something that I really like, working on the [Dasa](https://dasa.com.br/) e-commerce team (here are 2 projects that I participated on that: [Vacinas E-commerce](https://vacinas.com.br/) and [Chromatox E-commerce](https://www.chromatox.com.br/)), architecting and making the development of big, structured, tested, distributed and scalable softwares. I worked with *realy funcy stuff* like Clean Architecture, Kafka, PubSub by GCP, SOLID and OO concepts, Kubernetes/Rancher to manage Docker Containers, Unit Testing (with some theory), Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js, Redis and Postgres.

Now I'm building some software to give opportunities of people study here in Brazil, in a Fintech called [Provi](https://provi.com.br/) ([@provi-capital](https://github.com/provicapital)) on the Core team, dealing with financial solutions from student loans. My work is basically improve all Core (of company's financial bussiness logic) codebase with advanced concepts of architecture (domain driven architectures and event driven architecture), hard unit testing of a bunch of bussiness requirements and user edge cases and improving processes and flows company's operation the experience of all people involved on a student loan process (attendants, students, schools, teachers, etc) ‚Äî with technical solutions ‚Äî.
